Developing a custom web application requires a lot of effort and collaboration among team members. In this project, we led a team of eight to build a web app for Saint-Gobain, a multinational construction and high-performance materials company. Our goal was to create a tool that streamlined warehouse data collection, allowing workers to scan barcodes and add timestamps to a PostgreSQL database via a RESTful API built with Flask.

One of the primary components of our app was the RESTful API, which allowed us to interact with the database and retrieve information about the products and their production line. To build the API, we used Flask, a popular Python web framework that allowed us to create routes for different endpoints. We also used PostgreSQL to store the data, which provided robust security and efficient data management.

Once the backend was built, we needed to deploy it on a web server. After considering various options, we chose Heroku, a cloud-based platform that provided scalability and reliability. We also used Vercel to deploy the frontend, which allowed us to quickly and easily create a user interface that could be accessed from anywhere.

To make the app accessible to workers, we created a user-friendly frontend that allowed them to select their production line and scan barcodes to add timestamps to the database. The frontend was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which allowed us to create interactive and responsive user interfaces. We also used Figma, for designing the UI, that provided a consistent look and feel to the app.

In conclusion, we successfully built a custom web app for Saint-Gobain to help streamline warehouse data collection and improve productivity. By combining our skills in backend development, frontend development, and project management, we were able to lead a team of eight to build a high-quality app that met the client's needs. Throughout the development process, we encountered many challenges and learned valuable lessons that will help us in future projects.
