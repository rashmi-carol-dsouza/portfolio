I took part in Measure of Music, a music and data hackathon and was a part of the Winning Project "Collaborata".

Collaborata is an artist matching tool designed to facilitate international artist collaborations and make them more accessible. Collaborations are essential for artists who want to expand their fanbase in international markets where they lack organic connections and cultural knowledge. To help artists find the perfect collaborator, Collaborata matches them with the most compatible artists from the market they aim to break into, based on their relative sound and size.

To begin the process, users provide information on their genre, career stage, the market they would like to expand into, and the target genre they're looking to collaborate on. Collaborata then narrows down the search to relevant artists and computes a compatibility score by assessing the likelihood of a successful collaboration.

Collaborata's website is a React application, and the backend is built using Flask and deployed on Azure. Data is queried from Chartmetric and Luminate to help calculate the compatibility score. While Collaborata has its limitations, it can streamline the discovery process for A&R managers, help artist managers or bookers source support acts or target festival lineups, and allow independent artists to discover other artists from target markets at a similar career stage. I developed the backend and the compatibility score. I also deployed the backend to Azure 

In the future, our team plans to add more features to the platform to help identify unexpected mutual connections. We believes an enhanced compatibility score would work well as a paid feature to monetize the platform.
